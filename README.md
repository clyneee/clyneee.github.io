Its size and reach can extend to several times its normal size. Like other Anti Magic attacks, it is drawn toward magic, making it difficult for mages to dodge.

After merging with Liebe, the user raises the Demon-Slasher Katana above their head and then performs a downward slash, which produces a massive Anti Magic flying slash. The attack can travel for miles without losing its edge, and the slash will not injure the user's allies even if they are in the path of the attack.
